Just following the main web page "how to" thing.

Middle aged hardware guy trying to get caught up on the new fangled CS stuff like github.
OhmPossum -MSEE,  BS Computer Engineering from the olden days. I wrote my first program on a legal pad in 1979 for an Apple // when I was 11. My father helped me take it to Winthrop math department where we typed it in and debugged it. I started with a bouncing ball program and re-wrote it for 5 balls in Applesoft BASIC. When I was 12 I had to wait to use my saved up newspaper route money to buy the about to be released Apple ][+ from a local Ham Radio shop.
